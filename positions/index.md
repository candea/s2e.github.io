## Open Positions

### Software Engineer


We are preparing for release a brand-new version of S2E, called S2E2.
It has a rearchitected engine that is fast and modular, advanced support
for Windows and Linux guests, Python scripting, etc.
An alpha version of S2E2 was the fastest at finding vulnerabilities in the
[DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge](http://archive.darpa.mil/cybergrandchallenge/).

We're looking for people to join us ASAP in this effort. If you’re a
hardcore systems programmer, are passionate about security, and want to
revolutionize the level of reliability and security in systems software, let’s talk!

You’ll be joining the research [team](/people) at [EPFL](http://www.epfl.ch) and will collaborate with [Cyberhaven](http://cyberhaven.io),
an advanced software security startup located at the [EPFL
Innovation Park](http://epfl-innovationpark.ch/),
on the shore of Lake Geneva. The project is sponsored by the [Swiss Commission for Technology and Innovation](https://www.kti.admin.ch/kti/en/home.html).

We’re looking for people who are exceptionally strong in computer systems,
love hacking both inside and outside an OS kernel, and have a proven track
record of building systems, contributing to open source projects, etc.
